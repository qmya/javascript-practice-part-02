//functions: A piece of code that we can reuse in our code over & over again like variable but it consist of many lines

//simple function

//to use the above function we simply write like this üëáüèΩ
logger(); //this is also called invoking,running or calling a function

//A function can also recieve a data and also return an output
//think like a function is a machine üì†
